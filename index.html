        <h3>My sons, Ethan and Luke</h3>
        <img src="images/family.jpg" alt="family" class="round">
        <p>My boys are with me wherever we go. There is rarely a dull moment. I have the best friends I could have. I am usually found at home caring for my youngest. He had health problems that we are continually staying positive and diligent to his care and needs. But that doesn't stop us from doing the most in our life! Being a drive away from a beach is great! While tanning at the beach, my boys are enjoying the ocean. We try to find our own fun. Hiking or playing at a park with Max. My oldest is doing well in school and is finding success in art. Seeing him grow up being his own person and spreading his joy, is my way of success. My youngest always brings others to smile and his playful imagination inspires me to look at the world around us as brighter and awe-inspiring.</p>

        <h3>My Best Friend Max</h3>
        <img src="images/andrea-max-bed.jpg" alt="Andrea and Max" class="round">
        <p>A friend needed someone to care for their puppies. I was not a dog person, but I felt that once I met Max, I knew he would be a welcome addition to our family. Max is a gentle soul, outgoing and loving. He is everything I needed at that time of my life, and now we are inseparable. I love how caring and protective he is to us and our family. Max has really brought me out of my depression and got me back to myself. We will be celebrating his birthday next month with plays at the park, snacks and chew toys. He will be eight, which is how long he has been in my life and a part of my family.</p>
